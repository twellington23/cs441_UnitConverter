    This is an Android application used to determine how many months of a subscription service someone can afford can afford. This was achieved by using the Basic Activity template in Android Studio, as well as a few other Android Studio widgets. The two most crucial widgets here are the Spinner and EditText. The EditText widegt allows the user to manually enter data, and the Spinner allows the user to select an item from a drop down menu. The data provided by the user in both of these widgets is used to make the proper conversion.

The application functions as follows:
- Click on the EditText space next to "Your budget is: $"
- Enter an integer
- Click the Spinner (drop down menu) under "Subscription Service:"
- Select a service
- Press the search button in the bottom right corner of the screen

    After following these steps, the application will then take the integer you entered and the subcription service you selected, and return how many months of the service you can afford on your current budget and how much money you need to purchase an extra month.
